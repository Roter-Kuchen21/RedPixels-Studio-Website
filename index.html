                <h2>Privacy Policy — Mythical Egg Guardian: TD (RedPixels Studio)</h2>
                <p><strong>Effective date: September 4, 2025</strong></p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Mythical Egg Guardian: TD (the "Application"), developed and provided by RedPixels Studio (the "Service Provider", "we", "us" or "our"), handles information. By downloading or using the Application you accept the practices described in this policy.</p>

                <h3>Information we collect</h3>
                <p>The Application itself does not collect, transmit, or store personal data or device data when you download or use it, except as described below for third-party services used for optional features (for example: leaderboards). No registration or account within the app is required.</p>

                <h3>Precise location information</h3>
                <p>The Application does not collect precise real-time location information from your device.</p>

                <h3>Third parties, SDKs, analytics, advertising</h3>
                <p>The Application integrates Google Play Games Services for optional social features such as leaderboards and achievements. The Play Games Services SDK is a third-party service provided by Google and may collect or process certain information necessary for those features, including player identifiers, leaderboard/achievement activity, and related gameplay metadata. This data collection is performed by Google as the third-party SDK provider and is subject to Google's privacy practices and the user's Play Games privacy settings. We do not use any advertising SDKs or analytics libraries beyond those required by Play Games for these features. We will update this Privacy Policy and the Google Play Data Safety form if we integrate additional third-party services.</p>

                <h3>Sharing and disclosures</h3>
                <p>Because the Application itself does not collect user data beyond what the third-party Play Games SDK requires for leaderboard/achievement features, we do not otherwise share, sell, or disclose personal information to third parties. Where data is processed by Google (via Play Games Services) that processing is governed by Google's policies and disclosures; developers publishing on Google Play must disclose such SDKs and the categories of data they handle.</p>

                <h3>Data Safety & Google Play</h3>
                <p>We have completed (or will complete) the Google Play Data Safety form and have disclosed the use of Google Play Games Services. The Data Safety form lists the categories of data that are collected and shared by the app and any integrated SDKs. If we add any third-party SDKs, analytics, or data collection in the future, we will update both the Data Safety form and this Privacy Policy promptly.</p>

                <h3>Children</h3>
                <p>The Application is not intended to collect information from children under 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13. Parents and guardians should monitor their children's use of the Application. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information to us through the Application, contact us and we will take steps to remove that information. (We require users to be at least 16 to consent to processing in some countries; where appropriate a parent/guardian must consent.)</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>Because the Application does not collect or retain user information beyond what is necessary for optional Play Games features, there is no personal data stored on our servers at this time. Still, we take reasonable administrative measures to ensure the Application and any future servers or services we use are secured. We will update this policy if our security practices change.</p>

                <h3>Data retention</h3>
                <p>Not applicable — the Application does not collect or store user data outside of what the Play Games SDK processes for leaderboard/achievement features. Data processed by Google Play Games may be retained in accordance with Google's policies.</p>

                <h3>User rights (EU / GDPR)</h3>
                <p>If you are an EU resident, the GDPR grants you certain rights regarding personal data, including access, correction, erasure, portability, restriction of processing, and objection. Because the Application does not directly collect personal data (aside from data processed by Play Games Services), these rights are not currently exercised through our systems; however, if we begin collecting data directly in the future we will provide mechanisms for you to exercise these rights and disclose the lawful basis for processing.</p>

                <h3>California residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
                <p>If you are a California resident, you may have rights to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of your personal information under California law. Because we do not collect or sell personal information, those rights are not currently applicable. If this changes, we will publish instructions for exercising rights and comply with applicable laws.</p>

                <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes (for example: adding data collection, analytics, or ad SDKs), we will revise the "Effective date" above and post the updated policy at the same public URL.</p>

                <h3>Contact us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact:<br>
                Email: egg.guardians.td@gmail.com</p>

                <h3>Other legal notes</h3>
                <p>This policy is intended to be readable and clear. It does not create contractual rights or obligations beyond those required by law.</p>
